Teaching is one of my favorite parts of the academic profession, and a service I hope to be able to continue. Watching that spark of understanding in others is a joy. But as educators, we also have a big responsibility towards students, towards ensuring equitable outcomes, opportunities and practices, and ensuring that students of all backgrounds can thrive. I will soon put up a list of resources on inclusive and student-centred pedagogy that I have found to be useful.

A list of my own teaching experience:
