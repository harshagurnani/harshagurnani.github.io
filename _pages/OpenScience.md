Science is not just the end product of the scientific process, but a whole ecosystem of knowledge - methodology, data, tools. Freely and openly sharing these resources not just increases scientific reproducibility and collective understanding, but is a practice of inclusivity, sustainability, and fairness.

Please refer to the [Publications page](/publications/) for access to pdf+data/code of peer-reviewed articles.
