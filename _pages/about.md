I am a [Schmidt Science postdoctoral fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellows/?fellow-keyword=&fellow-year=2022&filter=true) in neuroscience. I am broadly interested in the __multiple ways we learn__  - combining observations and guesses, as specific rules or general concepts, motivated by reward or internal goals. This learning is ultimately enabled and implemented via circuits in our brain - how does the architecture and activity of relevant brain regions allow us to exploit the structure of "the world as it is", while remaining enormously flexible, allowing us to learn to use new tools and concepts that human creativity continually produces?

## Research interests:

I am interested in forms of __error-driven learning__ (e.g. sensory- and reward-prediction errors) that rely on two critical features:
- _feedback_ (via sensory experiences), and 
- _internal models_ (models of the world and body that allow us to predict the consequences of our actions, to plan and to simulate). 

I link computational descriptions of learning to mechanistic and algorithmic accounts of how related neural _dynamics_ support the __rapid and flexible updating of internal representations__ on slow (hours) and fast (seconds) timescales.

I am also interested in the role of __probabilistic reasoning__ in learning and adaptation, as uncertainty due to noisy observations or via latent state inference.

I  use a variety of experimental and quantitative approaches - __neural recording and perturbation__ tools, __behavioural assays__ in rodents, __neural network models__, __latent variable modeling__, __deep learning__, and __statistical analysis__ of high-dimensional data.




## Current work:
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow with [Prof Bing Brunton](https://www.bingbrunton.com/) at the University of Washington, Seattle. In 2022, I was awarded a [Schmidt Science postdoctoral fellowship](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellows/?fellow-keyword=&fellow-year=2022&filter=true) to pivot from neurophysiology and learn techniques such as __data-driven dynamical systems__ modelling and __control__. These techniques will be critical for closed-loop interrogation of brain-and-behaviour (e.g. with optogenetics or electrical stimulation) by better accounting for the system dynamics.

My current project explores the __control of recurrent neural dynamics__ (such as activity in motor cortex) via feedback inputs, and the role of __flexible feedback modulation in motor adaptation__. This may helps us better dissect the mechanisms of short-term adaptation versus long-term learning, and guide the design of more learnable brain-computer interfaces as rehabilitative devices.

## Previously:
I obtained my PhD with [Prof Angus Silver](https://silverlab.org/) at University College London, funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship. I examined neural activity in the cerebellar input layer, with a focus on inhibitory Golgi cells and the multiple roles of electrical coupling. I focussed on two main questions:

1. What is the __dynamical regime of electrically coupled networks__, and how is this determined by the connectivity structure and input statistics?

2. How is sensorimotor information, entering the cerebellar cortex via __pontine mossy fibres, transformed and reorganised within cerebellar circuits__ to aid associative learning?


Before that, I studied Biology and Mathematics as an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
