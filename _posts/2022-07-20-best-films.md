I have a strong preference for languid, introspective films - conversations filled with silences, lingering shots, dusty cities coming alive at night, human movement as a choreography through scenes. These include New Wave and contemporary directors both in Europe and (South) East Asia. Here's a non-exhaustive list of some recommendations from this "genre":

Hou Hsiao-Hsien (Taiwanese New Wave)
======
people's movements as choreography through the frame. we are transiently occpying these spaces that are both dynamic and longer lasting than any of us. tranquility. meditative. observant. and modernity - that ineffable quality.

Daughter of the Nile (1987)
--------

The Boy from FengKuei
---------

Edward Yang
=========
Developing economy


Hong San-Soo
============

As easily watchable as Eric Rohmer or Woody Allen, 30-somethings, esp men, that enjoy falling in love - but commitment is hard  -and melancholic, the sameness. Yet despite the self-mockery, his films have more grace in its self-awareness.


The Woman Who Ran (2020)

So Long, My Son

David Lynch

Joachim Trier/ Oslo Trilogy
=======

Ritwik Ghatak

Satyajit choreography
